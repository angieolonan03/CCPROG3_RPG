# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION
The Pokemon Game (Major Course Output) API is a Java-based library that enables developers to create text-based Pokemon games. It provides a set of classes and methods for managing in-game activities, including creature interactions, inventory management, area exploration, and creature evolution. With an intuitive design and comprehensive functionalities, the API allows users to easily create interactive Pokemon game experiences.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The goal of the program is to catch and evolve creatures. The program starts by asking the user to select one (1) evolutionary level 1 (i.e. EL1) starter creature, which is automatically added to their inventory, and set as their active creature. Then, the user is shown the menu screen, which contains the following 
                                    OPTIONS : 
                                    [1] View Inventory 
                                    [2] Explore an Area
                                    [3] Evolve Creature
                                    [4] Exit. 
# PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Pokemon Game (Major Course Output) API is to simplify the development of text-based Pokemon games, providing a framework for managing various game elements such as creatures, inventories, areas, and gameplay mechanics. By abstracting complex game logic into resuable components, the API streamlines the development process and enables developers to focus on creating engaging and immersive gameplay experiences.

# KEY FEATURES:
1. Creature Management: Easily modify and manage different types of creatures with varying attributes such as family, type, level, and health points.
2. Inventory System: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of captured creatures, allowing for easy tracking and manipulation of available resources.
3. Area Exploration: Facilitate the exploration of different areas within the game world, enabling users to navigate and interact with diverse environments.
4. Evolution Mechanism: Implement a straightforaward evolution system that allows creatures to evolve based on specific conditions and criteria.
5. User Interaction: Enable user input and interaction through intuitive menus and prompts, ensuring a seamless and engaging gaming experience.

# INTENDED AUDIENCE:
The Pokemon Game (Major Course Output) API is primarily designed for game developers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts interested in creating text-based Pokemon games. It is suitable for individuals with a fundamental understanding of Java programming and a basic knowledge of game development concepts. Users should be familiar with object-oriented programming principles and have a grasp of key gaming terminology such as creatures, evolution, inventory, and gameplay mechanics.
